### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      # should be == 1
      return True
    else
    # should be a colon after else
      return False
   

  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  # should be def not dif
  # should be comma after card1
  if card1.value > card2.value:
  # this if..else statement should be indented
    return card
    # card is not defined in this function - should be card1
  else:
    return card2
  


def cards_total(self, cards):
# should be indented
  total
  #should be total = 0
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
    # indentation is wrong - return should be lined up with the for statement
  
```
